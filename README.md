# Distinct-Arithmetic-Sequences

The problem you've described involves transforming a given non-decreasing sequence A into an arithmetic sequence through a series of operations that allow you to swap elements between sequence A and another non-decreasing sequence B. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Input Sequences**:
   - Sequence A: This is the sequence you want to transform into an arithmetic sequence. It is given as A = (a1, a2, ..., an).
   - Sequence B: This is another non-decreasing sequence that you can use to perform swaps with sequence A. It is given as B = (b1, b2, ..., bm).

2. **Operations**:
   - You are allowed to choose any two indices i and j from sequences A and B, respectively.
   - You can then perform a swap operation, which means you exchange the elements at indices i and j.
   - You can repeat this operation as many times as needed.

3. **Goal**:
   - Your objective is to transform sequence A into an arithmetic sequence.
   - An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. In other words, you want to make the differences between consecutive elements of sequence A the same.

4. **Restrictions and Possibilities**:
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that you can manipulate the differences between elements in sequence A by choosing appropriate swaps.
   - You can use sequence B to adjust the values in sequence A to achieve this goal.
   - By performing swaps strategically, you aim to make all the differences between consecutive elements in A equal, turning it into an arithmetic sequence.

5. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - A possible algorithm to achieve this transformation is to:
     1. Sort sequence A in non-decreasing order if it's not already sorted.
     2. Initialize a variable to store the common difference for the arithmetic sequence.
     3. Iterate through A, calculating the difference between consecutive elements and updating the common difference as needed.
     4. Determine which elements in B could be swapped with the elements in A to make the differences equal. This may require some calculations to find suitable pairs.
     5. Perform swaps between A and B according to your calculations until all differences between consecutive elements in A are equal.
     6. After the swaps, you may need to rearrange the elements in A to have them in ascending order.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The complexity of solving this problem depends on the size of sequences A and B and the specific algorithm you use. If done optimally, it can be solved efficiently.

In summary, the problem involves transforming a non-decreasing sequence A into an arithmetic sequence by performing swaps with another non-decreasing sequence B. The key to solving it is to manipulate the differences between elements in A through strategic swaps until they become equal, resulting in an arithmetic sequence. The specific approach and complexity depend on the size of the sequences and the chosen algorithm.

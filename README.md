# Distinct-Arithmetic-Sequences

Transforming a given non-decreasing sequence A into an arithmetic sequence through a series of operations that allow you to swap elements between sequence A and another non-decreasing sequence B. 

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Input Sequences**:
   - Sequence A: This is the sequence you want to transform into an arithmetic sequence. It is given as A = (a1, a2, ..., an).
   - Sequence B: This is another non-decreasing sequence that you can use to perform swaps with sequence A. It is given as B = (b1, b2, ..., bm).

2. **Operations**:
   - Choose any two indices i and j from sequences A and B, respectively.
   - Perform a swap operation, which means you exchange the elements at indices i and j.
   - Repeat this operation as many times as needed.

3. **Goal**:
   - Finding the number of arithmetic sequences.
